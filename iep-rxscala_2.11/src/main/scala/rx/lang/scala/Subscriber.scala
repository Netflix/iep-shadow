/**
 * An extension of the [[Observer]] trait which adds subscription handling
 * ([[unsubscribe]], [[isUnsubscribed]], and `add` methods) and backpressure handling
 * ([[onStart]] and [[request]] methods).
 *
 * After a [[Subscriber]] calls an [[Observable]]'s `subscribe` method, the
 * [[Observable]] calls the [[Subscriber]]'s [[onNext]] method to emit items. A well-behaved
 * [[Observable]] will call a [[Subscriber]]'s [[onCompleted]] method exactly once or the [[Subscriber]]'s
 * [[onError]] method exactly once.
 * 
 * Similarly to the RxJava `Subscriber`, this class has two constructors:
 * 
 * The first constructor takes as argument the child [[Subscriber]] from further down the pipeline
 * and is usually only needed together with [[Observable.lift lift]]:
 * 
 * {{{
 * myObservable.lift((subscriber: Subscriber[T]) => new Subscriber[T](subscriber) {
 *   override def onStart(): Unit = ...
 *   override def onNext(n: T): Unit = ...
 *   override def onError(e: Throwable): Unit = ...
 *   override def onCompleted(): Unit = ...
 * })
 * }}}
 * 
 * The second constructor takes no arguments and is typically used with the subscribe method:
 * 
 * {{{
 * myObservable.subscribe(new Subscriber[T] {
 *   override def onStart(): Unit = ...
 *   override def onNext(n: T): Unit = ...
 *   override def onError(e: Throwable): Unit = ...
 *   override def onCompleted(): Unit = ...
 * })
 * }}}
 * 
 * Notice that these two constructors are not (as usually in Scala) in the companion object,
 * because if they were, we couldn't create anonymous classes implementing
 * `onStart`/`onNext`/`onError`/`onCompleted` as in the examples above.
 * However, there are more constructors in the companion object, which allow you to construct
 * Subscribers from given `onNext`/`onError`/`onCompleted` lambdas.

  // Implementation note:
  // If the Subscriber() constructor was used, we have to call the iep.rx.Subscriber() constructor 
  // to construct the asJavaSubscriber, and if the Subscriber(Subscriber) constructor was used, we have
  // to call the iep.rx.Subscriber(iep.rx.Subscriber) constructor.
  // The obvious way to achieve this would be to have a primary constructor which takes an
  // underlying iep.rx.Subscriber, and add two secondary constructors, Subscriber() and Subscriber(Subscriber),
  // which call the primary constructor with the right iep.rx.Subscriber.
  // But this does not work because a secondary constructor does not have access to self before it
  // calls the primary constructor, and we need `self` to create the iep.rx.Subscriber.
  // So we have to construct the asJavaSubscriber in the primary constructor (=class body) of Subscriber,
  // and we model the Subscriber() constructor as Subscriber(null).
  // Notice that the apply(iep.rx.Subscriber) constructor in the companion object will override this asJavaSubscriber.
